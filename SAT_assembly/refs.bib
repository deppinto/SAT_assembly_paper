abstract = {‘Bottom-up fabrication', which exploits the intrinsic properties of atoms and molecules to direct their self-organization, is widely used to make relatively simple nanostructures. A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by ‘top-down' methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide ‘staple strands' to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex). DNA is a popular building block for nanostructures as it combines self-assembly with programmability and a plethora of chemical techniques for its manipulation. There is an extensive literature on DNA nanomaterials, but a procedure described this week breaks many of the fabrication rules established in the field. Paradoxically, although it ignores sequence design, strand purity and strand concentration ratios, the new method yields DNA nanostructures that are larger and more complex than previously possible. The one-pot method uses a few hundred short DNA strands to ‘staple' a very long strand into two-dimensional structures that adopt any desired shape, like the ‘nanoface' on the cover. Individual staples can be made into nanometre-scale pixels that create surface patterns on a given 100-nm shape (like the Americas map and snowflakes), or to combine shapes into larger structures (the hexagon of triangles). A robust, versatile, one-pot bottom-up nanotechnology fabrication method uses a few-hundred short DNA strands to 'staple' a very long strand into two-dimensional structures of 100 nm in diameter and resembling any desired shape, such as squares, 'nanofaces' and stars.},

abstract = {We have observed a metallic solid (Al-14-at. /o-Mn) with long-range orientationai order, but with icosahedral point group symmetry, which is inconsistent with lattice translations. Its diffraction spots are as sharp as those of crystals but cannot be indexed to any Bravais lattice. The solid is metastable and forms from the melt by a first-order transition. PACS numbers: 61.50.Em, 61.55.Hg, 64.70.Ew We report herein the existence of a metallic solid which diffracts electrons like a single crystal but has point group symmetery rn35 (icosahedral) which is inconsistent with lattice translations. If the specimen is rotated through the angles of this point group (Fig. 1), selected-area electron diffraction patterns clearly display the six fivefold, ten threefold , and fifteen twofold axes characteristic' of icosahedral symmetry (Fig. 2). Grains up to 2 p, m in size with this structure form in rapidly cooled alloys of Al with 10-14 at. '/0 Mn, Fe, or Cr. We will refer to the phase as the icosahedral phase. Micro-diffraction from many different volume elements of a grain and dark-field imaging from various diffrac-tion spots confirm that entire grains have long-range orientational order. If the orientational order decays with distance, its correlation length is far greater than the grain size. We have thus a solid metallic phase with no translational order and with with long-range orientational order. The remarkable sharpness of the diffraction spots (Fig. 2) indicates a high coherency in the spatial interference , comparable to the one usually encountered in crystals. The diffraction data are qualitatively well fitted by a model consisting of a random packing of nonoverlapping parallel icosahedra attached by edges. The invariance of the local orien-tational symmetry from site to site and the finite number of possible translations between two adjacent icosahedra seem to be sufficient for insuring highly coherent interferences.},

abstract = {Icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs) are materials that exhibit long-range order but lack periodicity in any direction. Although IQCs were the first reported quasicrystals1, they have been experimentally observed only in metallic alloys2, not in other materials. By contrast, quasicrystals with other symmetries (particularly dodecagonal) have now been found in several soft-matter systems3–5. Here we introduce a class of IQCs built from model patchy colloids that could be realized experimentally using DNA origami particles. Our rational design strategy leads to systems that robustly assemble in simulations into a target IQC through directional bonding. This is illustrated for both body-centred and primitive IQCs, with the simplest systems involving just two particle types. The key design feature is the geometry of the interparticle interactions favouring the propagation of an icosahedral network of bonds, despite this leading to many particles not being fully bonded. As well as furnishing model systems in which to explore the fundamental physics of IQCs, our approach provides a potential route towards functional quasicrystalline materials. Model patchy colloids with directional bonding are designed that assemble into icosahedral quasicrystals through the propagation of an icosahedral network of bonds and may be realized using DNA origami particles.},

@article{Franz2017,
abstract = {Random constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) have been studied extensively using statistical physics techniques. They provide a benchmark to study average case scenarios instead of the worst case one. The interplay between statistical physics of disordered systems and computer science has brought new light into the realm of computational complexity theory, by introducing the notion of clustering of solutions, related to replica symmetry breaking. However, the class of problems in which clustering has been studied often involve discrete degrees of freedom: Standard random CSPs are random K-SAT (aka disordered Ising models) or random coloring problems (aka disordered Potts models). In this work we consider instead problems that involve continuous degrees of freedom. The simplest prototype of these problems is the perceptron. Here we discuss in detail the full phase diagram of the model. In the regions of parameter space where the problem is non-convex, leading to multiple disconnected clusters of solutions, the solution is critical at the SAT/UNSAT threshold and lies in the same universality class of the jamming transition of soft spheres. We show how the critical behavior at the satisfiability threshold emerges, and we compute the critical exponents associated to the approach to the transition from both the SAT and UNSAT phase. We conjecture that there is a large universality class of non-convex continuous CSPs whose SAT-UNSAT threshold is described by the same scaling solution.},

Containerlike protein architectures such as viral capsids and ferritin are examples of such biological templates. These protein cages have three distinct interfaces that can be synthetically exploited: the interior, the exterior, and the interface between subunits. The subunits that comprise the building blocks of these structures can be modified both chemically and genetically in order to impart designed functionality to different surfaces of the cage. Therefore, the cages possess a great deal of synthetic flexibility, which allows for the introduction of multifunctionality in a single cage. In addition, hierarchical assembly of the functionalized cages paves the way for development of a new class of materials with a wide range of applications from electronics to biomedicine. {\textcopyright} 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

@article{Mosayebi2017,
abstract = {The formation of quasi-spherical cages from protein building blocks is a remarkable self-assembly process in many natural systems, where a small number of elementary building blocks are assembled to build a highly symmetric icosahedral cage. In turn, this has inspired synthetic biologists to design de novo protein cages. We use simple models, on multiple scales, to investigate the self-assembly of a spherical cage, focusing on the regularity of the packing of protein-like objects on the surface. Using building blocks, which are able to pack with icosahedral symmetry, we examine how stable these highly symmetric structures are to perturbations that may arise from the interplay between flexibility of the interacting blocks and entropic effects. We find that, in the presence of those perturbations, icosahedral packing is not the most stable arrangement for a wide range of parameters; rather disordered structures are found to be the most stable. Our results suggest that (i) many designed, or even natural, protein cages may not be regular in the presence of those perturbations and (ii) optimizing those flexibilities can be a possible design strategy to obtain regular synthetic cages with full control over their surface properties.},

abstract = {Structured DNA assemblies have been designed primarily on a three-dimensional lattice because it is easy to arrange and cross-link the helices there. However, when we design free-form structures including wireframes and topolog-ically closed circular objects on a lattice, artificially stretched bonds connecting bases are inevitably and arbitrarily formed. They often lead to nonconvergence or convergence to a wrong configuration in computational analysis to predict the equilibrium shape of the structure when started from its lattice-based configuration, which hinders the design process of free-form structures. Here, we present a computational procedure enabling the shape prediction of free-form structures from their lattice-based design blueprint without any convergence issue. It automatically partitions the structure into substructures and relocates them into a new configuration. When the analysis for calculating the equilibrium shape begins from this configuration, no convergence issue occurs because substructures and stretched bonds connecting them do not overlap and intertwine each other during analysis. Using the proposed approach, we could obtain the free-form shape of a comprehensive set of wireframe and circular structures accurately and quickly. We further demonstrated that it also facilitated a design of wireframe structures with nonstraight edges.},

While these assemblies have numerous applications in nanoscale materials fabrication due to their nanoscale spatial addressability and high degree of customization, no easy-to-use graphical user interface software yet exists to deploy these algorith-mic approaches within a single, standalone interface. Further, top-down sequence design of 3D DX-based objects previously enabled by DAEDALUS was limited to discrete edge lengths and uniform vertex angles , limiting the scope of objects that can be designed.

abstract = {Colloidal particles are considered ideal building blocks to produce materials with enhanced physical properties. The state-of-the-art techniques for synthesizing these particles provide control over shape, size, and directionality of the interactions. In spite of these advances, there is still a huge gap between the synthesis of individual components and the management of their spontaneous organization towards the desired structures. The main challenge is the control over the dynamics of self-organization. In their kinetic route towards thermodynamically stable structures, colloidal particles self-organize into intermediate (mesoscopic) structures that are much larger than the individual particles and become the relevant units for the dynamics. To follow the dynamics and identify kinetically trapped structures, one needs to develop new theoretical and numerical tools. Here we discuss the self-organization of functionalized colloids (also known as patchy colloids) on attractive substrates. We review our recent results on the adsorption and relaxation and explore the use of annealing cycles to overcome kinetic barriers and drive the relaxation towards the targeted structures.},

abstract = {Higher-order structures that originate from the specific and reversible DNA-directed self-assembly of microscopic building blocks hold great promise for future technologies. Here, we functionalized biotinylated soft colloid oil-in-water emulsion droplets with biotinylated single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides using streptavidin as an intermediary linker. We show the components of this modular linking system to be stable and to induce sequence-specific aggregation of binary mixtures of emulsion droplets. Three length scales were thereby involved: nanoscale DNA base pairing linking microscopic building blocks resulted in macroscopic aggregates visible to the naked eye. The aggregation process was reversible by changing the temperature and electrolyte concentration and by the addition of competing oligonucleotides. The system was reset and reused by subsequent refunctionalization of the emulsion droplets. DNA-directed self-assembly of oil-in-water emulsion droplets, therefore, offers a solid basis for programmable and recyclable soft materials that undergo structural rearrangements on demand and that range in application from information technology to medicine.},

abstract = {Patchy colloids with three and four equivalent patches, confined in an attractive random porous medium, undergo re-entrant gas–liquid phase separation with the liquid phase density approaching zero at low temperatures. The (bonding) colloid–colloid interaction causes the liquid–gas phase separation, which is modulated by the presence of the randomly distributed hard-sphere obstacles, attracting the colloids via Yukawa potential. Due to this interaction, a layer of mutually bonded colloids around the obstacles is formed. The network becomes nonuniform, with colloid particles locally centered on the obstacles. Features described in this article may open possibilities to produce equilibrium gels with predefined nonuniform distribution of particles and indicate how complicated the phase behavior of biological macromolecules in a crowded environment may be.},

Here, we provide a general framework which transforms the inverse problem of self-assembly of colloidal crystals into a Boolean satisfiability problem for which solutions can be found numerically. Given a reference structure and the desired number of components, our approach produces designs for which the target structure is an energy minimum, and also allows us to exclude solutions that correspond to competing structures.

Numerical simulations have contributed significantly to our understanding of the behaviour of patchy particles, but, although simple in principle, advanced simulation techniques are often required to sample the low temperatures and long time scales associated with their self-assembly behaviour. In this work we review the most popular simulation techniques that have been used to study patchy particles, with a special focus on Monte Carlo methods. We cover many of the tools required to simulate patchy systems, from interaction potentials to biased moves, cluster moves, and free energy methods. The review is complemented by an educationally-oriented Monte Carlo computer code that implements all the techniques described in the text to simulate a well-known tetrahedral patchy particle model.},

Many key insights on the physical properties of empty liquids have originated almost independently from the study of colloidal patchy particles on one side, and a large body of theoretical and experimental research on water on the other side. Patchy particles represent a family of coarse-grained potentials that allows for a precise control of both the geometric and the energetic aspects of bonding, while water has arguably the most complex phase diagram of any pure substance, and a puzzling amorphous phase behavior. It was only recently that the exchange of ideas from both fields has made it possible to solve long-standing problems and shed new light on the behavior of empty liquids. Here we highlight the connections between patchy particles and water, focusing on the modelling principles that make an empty liquid behave like water, including the factors that control the appearance of thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies, the possibility of liquid-liquid phase transitions, and the crystallization of open crystalline structures.},

	abstract = {We propose a general framework for solving inverse self-assembly problems, i.e. designing interactions between elementary units such that they assemble spontaneously into a predetermined structure. Our approach uses patchy particles as building blocks, where the different units bind at specific interaction sites (the patches), and we exploit the possibility of having mixtures with several components. The interaction rules between the patches is determined by transforming the combinatorial problem into a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) which searches for solutions where all bonds are formed in the target structure. Additional conditions, such as the non-satisfiability of competing structures (e.g. metastable states) can be imposed, allowing to effectively design the assembly path in order to avoid kinetic traps. We demonstrate this approach by designing and numerically simulating a cubic diamond structure from four particle species that assembles without competition from other polymorphs, including the hexagonal structure.}

abstract = {Theoretical models of colloids with directional and anisotropic interactions have predicted the existence of both liquids with vanishing density, and arrested networks at equilibrium — that is, not undergoing phase separation. Experimental evidence of empty liquids and equilibrium gels is now provided for Laponite, a synthetic clay. These observations further our understanding of anisotropic interactions in colloidal suspensions. The relevance of anisotropic interactions in colloidal systems has recently emerged in the context of the rational design of new soft materials1. Patchy colloids of different shapes, patterns and functionalities2 are considered the new building blocks of a bottom-up approach toward the realization of self-assembled bulk materials with predefined properties3,4,5,6,7. The ability to tune the interaction anisotropy will make it possible to recreate molecular structures at the nano- and micro-scales (a case with tremendous technological applications), as well as to generate new unconventional phases, both ordered and disordered. Recent theoretical studies8 suggest that the phase diagram of patchy colloids can be significantly altered by limiting the particle coordination number (that is, valence). New concepts such as empty liquids8—liquid states with vanishing density—and equilibrium gels8,9,10—arrested networks of bonded particles, which do not require an underlying phase separation to form11—have been formulated. Yet no experimental evidence of these predictions has been provided. Here we report the first observation of empty liquids and equilibrium gels in a complex colloidal clay, and support the experimental findings with numerical simulations.},

@article{Sciortino2009,
abstract = {We thoroughly investigate a simple model representative of the recently synthesized Janus particles, i.e., colloidal spherical particles whose surface is divided into two areas of different chemical composition. When the two surfaces are solvophilic and solvophobic, these particles constitute the simplest example of surfactants. The phase diagram includes a colloidal-poor (gas), colloidal-rich (liquid) demixing region, which is progressively suppressed by the insurgence of micelles, providing the first model in which micellization and phase separation are simultaneously observed. The coexistence curve is found to be negatively sloped in the temperature-pressure plane, suggesting that Janus particles can provide a colloidal system with anomalous thermodynamic behavior. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Smallenburg2013,
abstract = {Patchy colloidal systems consist of particles with attractive patches on them. If the bonds between particles are allowed to be flexible, a colloidal liquid state may be observed as the system approaches zero temperature. All liquids (except helium owing to quantum effects) crystallize at low temperatures, forming ordered structures. The competition between disorder, which stabilizes the liquid phase, and energy, which leads to a preference for the crystalline structure, inevitably favours the crystal when the temperature is lowered and entropy becomes progressively less relevant. The liquid state survives at low temperatures only as a glass, an out-of-equilibrium arrested state of matter. This textbook description holds inevitably for atomic and molecular systems, where particle interactions are set by quantum-mechanical laws. The question remains whether it holds for colloidal particles, where interparticle interactions are usually short-ranged and tunable. Here we show that for patchy colloids with limited valence1, conditions can be found for which the liquid phase is stable even in the zero-temperature limit. Our results offer fresh cues for understanding the stability of gels2 and the glass-forming ability of molecular network glasses3,4.},
